App Idea: 10,000 Hours Calculator with Empire Building Interface
 - The 10,000 Hours Calculator is an app designed to help users track their time spent learning or practicing a skill, inspired by the idea that it takes approximately 10,000 hours to master something. For every 10 hours a person spends working on their skill, they unlock the ability to build new structures in a growing empire. As the user continues to invest time, their empire expands, and they can see the development of their virtual city. The app combines time tracking with a fun, gamified experience where users can visualize their progress by expanding and upgrading their empire with new buildings as they reach milestones in their skill development. This concept was inspired by an app I saw my friend using, which grows trees and flowers for time spent workingâ€”creating a dynamic and engaging way to track progress and stay motivated.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One of the challenges I encountered while building the app was spending some time familiarizing myself with Swift to make the background color change functionality work properly. It took a bit of trial and error to get comfortable with how Swift handles UI elements and actions, but ultimately, I was able to implement the feature successfully.
